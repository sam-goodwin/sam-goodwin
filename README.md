I'm a developer who specializes in AWS, Compilers, SDKs and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). I'm working hard on creating the next-generation of type-safe, high-level tooling for the cloud, with a particular focus on the intersection of programming language theory and the cloud.

To see this in action, check out my project, [functionless](https://github.com/sam-goodwin/functionless), which leverages the TypeScript Compiler API to generate Apache Velocity Templates (VTL) and Amazon States Language from TypeScript code.

I've spent the past decade working at Amazon where I had the pleasure of building high-scale production services on AWS, and SDKs and Tools for AWS and Alexa. I pioneered the application of the [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) in the Alexa Skills Kit organization where I built a re-usable, secure-by-default and privacy-compliant Data Lake Construct. Later, I went on to lead the development of the [Alexa Conversations Description Language](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/conversations/about-acdl.html) (ACDL) compiler toolchain, a brand new programming language for Alexa AI. I have now left Amazon to focus on building the next-generation of IaC tooling.

I'd love to hear from you about your current experience building on AWS, Azure, GCP and Kubernetes! Feel free to schedule time with me on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/sam-goodwin/30min).
